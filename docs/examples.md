## Chat With Document
```json
{
  "name": "Chat With Document",

  "headMessages": [
    {
      "role": "system",

    }
  ],
  "maxContext": 80
}
```
### Usage 
1. Copy the JSON above and import it into the software if you haven't already.
2. Copy the text of the article you want to ask about.
3. Press `shift+space` to submit the article, and you will receive a "Document Received" message.
4. You can then proceed with your questions and interactions.
5. If you want to switch to a different article, you need to clear the context first.

##  Bi-Translator

Translate between the local language and English. For example: if the content in the clipboard is in English, then output it in Chinese; if the content in the clipboard is in Chinese, then translate it into English. Of course, you can also change "English" to any other language.

```json
{
    "name": "Bi-Translator",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "headMessages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "As an English-{{.mylang}} translator, your task is to accurately translate text between the two languages. Just give me result do not explain. Think carefully before give me result, it is important to me. "

        }
